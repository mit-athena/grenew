.SH NAME
grenew - get kerberos tickets, tokens, mappings, and zephyr authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
grenew [ user ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIgrenew\fR is a graphical interface duplicating the
functionality of the \fIrenew\fR program. It first prompts the user
for his or her password, and, using that password, attempts to
get the user a new kerberos ticket-granting ticket.  The new 
ticket will automatically expire 10 hours later. 

If \fIgrenew\fR was able to obtain these tickets, it uses them, 
and \fIfsid\fR, to reauthenticate the user to any file
servers from which he or she has file systems attached. This
re-authentication, like the new kerberos tickets, automatically
expires after 10 hours.

\fIgrenew\fR then attempts to re-authenticate the user to the
zephyr servers by using \fIzctl\fR. This is necessary to
authenticate zephyrgrams.
